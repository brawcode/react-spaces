# Custom resize handles

React spaces allows you to pass custom components to be used as resize handles using the `handleRender` prop. 
This is an alternative to overriding the default css classes and will give you more control.

Pass a function to the `handleRender` prop that will be called for every resize handle on that component. 

```tsx
// This example is literally what happens under the hood
<BottomResizable 
    size="50%" 
    handleRender={(props: IResizeHandleProps) => <div {...props}></div>}>
</BottomResizable>
```

You can determine the position of the handle by accessing the `props.key` property. This will allow you to render different handles depending
on where it should be positioned.

It's also important that you pass following props to the **top level** element for your custom component, if you don't resizing will not work on mouse drag:

```tsx
onMouseDown: (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLElement, MouseEvent>) => void;
onTouchStart: (e: React.TouchEvent<HTMLElement>) => void;
```
