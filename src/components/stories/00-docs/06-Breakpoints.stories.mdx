# Breakpoints

You can assign breakpoints to any type of Space by using the `breakpoints` prop. This can allow you to make modifications to the content
based on the width of the space.

The below example as 3 breakpoints.

```tsx
<BottomResizable 
    size="50%" 
    breakpoints={{ breakpoints: { sm: 150, md: 200, lg: 350 }}}
>
    <MyComponent />
</BottomResizable>
```

You can then utilise the `useBreakpoints` hook in any componenent that is rendered inside the space.

```tsx
const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
    const bp = useBreakpoints();

    if(bp === "sm") return <SmallComponent />
    if(bp === "md") return <MediumComponent />
    return <FallbackComponent />
}
```

You can also pass a callback to the `breakpoints` prop so you can react to those events further up the tree, if that's something you want.

```tsx

const handleBreakpointHit = (bp: string) => {
    switch(bp){
        // Do some stuff
    }
}

<BottomResizable 
    size="50%" 
    breakpoints={{ breakpoints: { sm: 150, md: 200, lg: 350 }, onBreakpointHit: (bp) => handleBreakpointHit(bp)}}
>
    <MyComponent />
</BottomResizable>
```
